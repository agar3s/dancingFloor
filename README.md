Mixing: turn based card with and rhythm based.
Fight to dominate the disco placing your frenetic cat followers in the dance floor.

Rules:
This is a two local player game, first player (green), second player (purple)
to place a cat in the game choose a cat card and put it in a lightning floor.
the game ends when there is no more space to put more cats.

the player with the high score win:
  - if the value in the right corner is greater than 0 player One wins
  - if the value in the right corner is less than 0 player Two wins
  - if the value in the right corner is equal than 0 player is a draw

Turn
 select a cat card and place it in a valid space:
   - a cell with your same color is a valid place to put a card
   - a red one cell is a valid place
 invalid cells
   - a gray one cell is not a valid place
   - a yellow cell is not a valid place
   - a cell with your opponent cell color is not a valid place

if you place a card in an invalid cell you lose the turn.
you can check the color of the current player looking the beat dots in the right
